Dubson suggestions on HTML5 Faraday’s Law sim 1.0.0-dev.1
1)	Round corners of wires at 90 degree bends, very slightly.   Wires don’t have sharp corners when they are bent.
2)	On voltmeter, the semi-circle of the read-out should be centered in the white frame.  So should be moved down slightly.
3)	Arrow head on voltmeter needle should be made a little more narrow.  See original sim.
4)	Lighten grey terminals of voltmeter a little to improve contrast between +/- signs and terminal body.
5)	When bulb lights, grey body of light bulb should become white.  Currently, when bulb lights, the bulb itself remain dark.
6)	The 1-coil/2-coil control looks too dark.  There is poor contrast between the coil icons and the background.      
7)	Field lines should be approximately equally spaced where they enter/exit the magnet. Currently, pairs of lines converge to a single point on the end of the magnet.
